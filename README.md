# Shopping-Cart

## Title of the project
Build Restocking Function

## Description of the project
Here’s how the reset stock feature works:

There’s an input field on the page that contains the URL to the Strapi back end
When a user clicks the “ReStock Products” button, a call is made to the Strapi back end specified in the input field
The result of this call is an updated list of products

## How to Run
Load index.html in a browser with cart.jsx in same dir

## Roadmap of future improvements
* Display error to user when no items left (currently printed to console.log)
* I restock to original numbers, but it seems like maybe is should be added to what we have? Maybe in a store they do just restock to original numbers.
* I need to update stock when I delete items from cart, not just when I add them
